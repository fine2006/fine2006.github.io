Hello! I am {{ site.author }} and this is my blog.
I am going to be writing about mostly programming and some other stuff
(a lot of stuff about using linux probably :P)

I am also going to be talking about some other stuff,
such as animal rights and politics,
along with music (maybe if I learn theory)
but that is if I even write my first blog.

Welcome to this blog! I think I am going to commit to a new blog every tuesday, so that I get my ideas out and documented. I've thought of doing this for quite some time, but was putting it off due to various things. I'm not really good at programming yet, so this blog is mainly a journey to being a better programmer with a few (or many) detours.
